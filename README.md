CNN Happy or Frown Detector – A Beginner-Friendly Project
Developed a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect facial expressions—specifically identifying "Happy" or "Frown" emotions. 
This project serves as an introductory exercise to help beginners understand the core concepts of CNNs, including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. 
The project involved using a small dataset of facial images, applying basic data augmentation techniques, and evaluating model performance to achieve accurate classification.
